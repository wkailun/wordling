# Reflection Questions

Answer these questions thoroughly after completing the assignment, using examples from your code. Good answers will be 1-2 paragraphs that cite specific code examples and show a meaningful reflection on how your development went, and how it could be improved in the future.

## Question 1

 In the Black-Box testing for GameState.submitGuess() portion of the assignment, list the partitions of inputs and fields that you used for your test plan. Cite specific tests by name and line number that cover each partition. A bulleted list is acceptable here. You should include all of your tests covering at least one partition. Additionally, for each partition, label it is equivalence, boundary, or exception.

## Question 2

The function submitGuess(String) in WordleGameState can throw two different Exceptions. Why would we as developers intentionally design our program to throw Exceptions? What is the benefit?

## Answer

Developers intentionally design program to throw Exceptions as it is an essential part of handling errors. 
It allows developers to separate error handling code from the main code. This separation can make the 
code cleaner and more maintainable, and they can focus on writing code to handle specific errors in one place. 
Furthermore, by throwing exceptions when specific error conditions are met, developers can understand that something unexpected
has happened. This could help debug and handle errors better.
